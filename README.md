## The Pop Bottle Recycler

The final project of week 1 at Lighthouse Labs. A program that calculates how many bottles of pop you will get in total from your inital monetary and recycling empty bottles and bottle caps.

#### The Dev Process

Throughout the making of this project I've learnt important concepts and best practice implementation on:

1. Classes
2. Methods
3. RSpec testing
4. TDD

#### Heres how it works.

1. run `git clone https://github.com/johnnyji/bottleRecycler.git` in your command line and clone this project onto your computer

2. `cd` into the project directory

3. run `bundle install` to install all it's dependencies

4. run `rspec spec` from the project directory to run test cases

4. run `ruby main.rb` from the project directory

5. Enjoy!
